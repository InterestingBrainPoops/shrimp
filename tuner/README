how this is supposed to work


First start off with the inital seed

create x "children" by randomly modifying the initial seed

run y games with each child against the inital seed, use multithreading with a work queue

pick the highest snake (even if its the "parent") and store its metadata.

then start from line 6 and repeat until the program is interrupted
